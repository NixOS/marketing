* Analytics? Survey? How do we know we are doing the right thing?
* Where is NixOS? We need to add it back to the website.
* Survey: garbas looks into hosting this on AWS and does initial work on questions. Survey should be out in a “month”.
* SEO review
* (samueldr) We need to consider **also** having complete server-logs based to properly estimate the proportion of our requests that are not tracked with more in-depth tracking. This is because Netlify's doesn't have user agent information, or more raw information to estimate what proportion of the millions of queries were made by humans vs. bots.
(action points: figure out if we can get the raw logs; like e.g. S3 allows)
