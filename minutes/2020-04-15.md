## Agenda
## Please write below topics you would like to discuss and also a name who proposed the topic. Minutes can be written inline and extracted out later.
* \[garbas\] ANN: [https://planet.nixos.org](https://planet.nixos.org) is back
* \[garbas\] ANN: Download page, [https://nixos.org/download.html](https://nixos.org/download.html)
* \[garbas\] Landing page review
* Refresh what was discussed last time
* Share the screen and review the PR
* Nix vs NixOS in naming? Are we a Nix or NixOS community? Are there two communities?
* \[davidak\] we found a consent what the audience of NixOS is we want to focus on, but what is the audience of Nix? It might be different
* I think it’s less complicated than NixOS and could be used by novice users (with new UI) like just install, update and remove packages imperatively
* But of course also developers (dev environment) and advanced users
* \[garbas\] Communication in nixos community
* Currently we have:
* news ([https://nixos.org/news.html](https://nixos.org/news.html))
* weekly ([https://weekly.nixos.org](https://weekly.nixos.org))
* planet ([https://planet.nixos.org](https://planet.nixos.org))
* discourse announcement section ([https://discourse.nixos.org/c/announcements/8](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/announcements/8))
* Youtube ([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3vIimi9q4AT8EgxYp\_dWIw/featured](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3vIimi9q4AT8EgxYp_dWIw/featured))
* Stackoverflow, [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nixos](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nixos)
* All of the above “news” channels serve a certain purpose.
* One of the goals of the communication should be to help teams reach other parts of the community or even help them “talk” to outside of the community. Expose blogs in
* What are we missing?
* Calendar(s): Release calendar, events, meetups, online sessions, …
* \[davidak\] Map of events, future and past (so you see the nearest community) [https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/issues/200](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/issues/200)
* How are others doing it?
* \[davidak\] public communication style
* On social media (what should be our style of communication? Professional or personal? Are MEMES allowed? We could have a dedicated social media team that answers questions, retweet tweets that show how awesome NixOS is and articles etc, share polls which OS is the best. Do we want to be as annoying as Arch Linux users? I use NixOS btw)
* With press (elementary handels this topic perfectly with great visual release blog post and press kit. When we publish release announcements with screenshots, journalists and bloggers might just copy it and we get free publicity. This way we have control over how people see NixOS. but there is again the question, how do we describe the project so that journalists and their readers understand it :D [https://mastodon.social/@elementary/103952495024815573](https://mastodon.social/@elementary/103952495024815573) )
* At conferences and meetups (what communication style can we recommend for community events? Should NixOS users leave propaganda everywhere (always funny to see the NixOS install party advertisement on the toilet at chaos communication congress every year), wear merch, annoy people by saying NixOS is superior, even tho the others don’t ask for it?)
* *\[garbas\] search.nixos.org, currently at [https://nixos-search.netlify.com](https://nixos-search.netlify.com)*
* *Explain the goals (short/middle/long)*
* *Show current status and discuss*
* \[davidak\] “Instead of passively analysing logs, we could also ask directly for feedback like “was this page helpful? Did you find what you searched?” do we generally like this idea? Should we create a low priority issue for later or discuss later again?
* *\[davidak\] NixOS Community page redesign*
