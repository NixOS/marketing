## Agenda
*Notes taker: both of us*
Ongoing:
* \[garbas\] announcement video for Nix 2.6 was done
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0phsRoNWUgU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0phsRoNWUgU)
* [https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pull/791](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pull/791)
* *Showing stats for the 2.6 release video*
* *skepticism about the announcement working*
* *![][image2]*
* *![][image3]*
* *basically, best video ever*
* *conclusion is we MUST continue doing this*
* *rok thinks face cams are required for these (vdo.ninja)*
* *rok thinks about aiming for 10 minutes and not longer (more video editing)*
* \[samueldr\] common styles improvements (cont.)
* (rok merged two saturdays ago)
* Next to be merged \-\> [https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pull/789](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pull/789)
* *briefly: work is underway still*
* \[garbas\] survey.nixos.org (almost there)
* Fixed limesurvey in nixpkgs \-\> [https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/157832](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/157832)
* *^  would be ready to host*
* *\[open discussion linked to previous\] where do we do announcements? define a process.*
* *\-\> also decide where to document these processes*
* *nixos-homepage gh wiki?*
* \[garbas\] Language \+ Nix tutorials with \`nixos/templates\`
* [https://github.com/NixOS/templates/pull/18](https://github.com/NixOS/templates/pull/18)
* *rok wanted to bring attention that we need well-tested always-working templates… opinionated choices even*
* *expected user conversion: "hears about Nix, learns commands, soon after learning they can install packages, wants to create a project using Nix"*
* *intent: have templates that are language-specific,*
* *this repo will become the place for "language tutorials / frameworks / ecosystems"*
* *issue: we need to keep tutorials under CI to ensure they'll stay working*
* *problem: templates are a flake thing; we are not mentioning flakes at all on the website and tutorials…*
* *or: extract \`nix flake init\` into \`nix init\` since it's not a Flake thing?*
* *or using flake-compat, cheat and not mention flakes*
* *or stupid simply two tutorials (one flake one non-flake)*
* *though, we'll start by writing them with flakes, and reconvene when publishing to see whether we need non-flakes tutorials or not…*
* \[garbas\] nixos-homepage maintenance *(things that were done)*
* [https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pull/793](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pull/793)
* [https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pull/795](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pull/795)
* [https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pull/794](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pull/794)
* \[garbas\] social networks presence (twitter, …)
* *Formalizing processes for presence*
* *rok got access to \`@nixos\_org\`*
* *rotation for engaging with people, curating retweets and contents*
* *some stats: exponential growth in followers during the last 4 months*
* *figure out how to keep up the trend*
* *Q: brand personality? A: we need to define it.*
* *bare minimum? retweets of announcements and such*
* *in addition: trying to engage with people? funny contributions?*
* *answering Questions and issues?*
* *"CRM"-like relationship management ("buffer" "hootsuite")*
* *involve "twitter folks" in helping without being really part of the overall marketing team?*
* \[garbas\] looking into metric
* *looking at how we can get "nix by the numbers" done*
* *numbers needed for goals for growth*
* *we need to find out what the baseline is*
* *no stats for unofficial discord*
* *everything else seemed attainable (discourse, matrix, other stats)*
* *we're missing website data*
* *netlify: we could ask for S3 dump of logs*
* *moving elsewhere requires "preview build" feature in CI*
* *cloudflare pages? you need to use their builders*
* *vercel? needs to be looked at*
**DISCOURSE ANNOUNCEMENT**
**First NixOS Survey**
Please take 5-10 minutes to complete the survey here.  \[link\]
Since the Nix community has been growing faster and larger every month, it’s gotten harder to understand who makes up the community and what everyone cares about. So we’re conducting this survey to improve our understanding of those questions. We hope to use your responses to develop Nix, NixOS, and Nixpkgs to match your needs and come up with new ideas for growing and serving the community.
All the questions are optional, and all responses are automatically anonymized. We will publish major findings on discourse and nixos.org. We will NOT collect your name, phone number, github handle, IP address, or any other identifying information.
The questions in the survey cover:
•	Your background (e.g. What country are you from?)
•	The projects you use in the ecosystem (e.g. Are you using Nix on Mac or running NixOS or both)
•	How you use the projects (e..g How often do you use Nix? On what operating systems? Do you use experimental features?)
•	What you like and dislike about the projects (e.g. What do you think is already great about Nix? What do you want contributors to focus on improving?)
This is our first time running a survey like this, so we’re also looking for feedback on the survey itself to understand how we can do this better in the future\!
