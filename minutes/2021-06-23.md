## Agenda
## Please write below topics you would like to discuss and also a name who proposed the topic. Minutes can be written inline and extracted out later.
\- Proposed Topics
\- common Nix Community story of benefits of CA and 100% reproducible image
\- statistics of users/cache usage exposed and communicated on nixos.org
\- fastly in front of s3
\- worth having large-scale granularity
\- change over time
\- customizing a package means you’re not represented (since you don’t hit the cache)
\- corporate adoption relies on signals like growth of community, usage, and metrics (engineering usage vs community-wide metrics)
\- samueldr: git/github metrics, unique contributors, commits, PRs, issues
\- barry: github contribution dataset that benchmarks nix / nixpkgs
\- absolute numbers in "community water hole", e.g. discourse, matrix
\-"Nix: by the numbers": requires champion, support from core infrastructure team, publish in NixOS weekly (https://weekly.nixos.org/). Utilize repology.org? (good idea)
\- Survey:
\- Questions to understand who is using Nix
\- Questions to understand what projects are being used
\- Controversial RFCs
\- nixos internship on the topic: adding flakes to search.nixos.org
\- language specific tutorials  tom is working on it.  A PR might come next meeting
\- Continued Topics
* Website content: NixOS, Tutorials, ...
* how-to docs, Go, python, format
* Other website redesign: status.nixos.org, search.nixos.org
* Survey (What is the state of the community?) \- contact: davidak
* Analytics (Are we going in the right direction?)
* (see statistics discussion above)
