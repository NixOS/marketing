## Agenda
## Please write below topics you would like to discuss and also a name who proposed the topic. Minutes can be written inline and extracted out later.
* \[garbas\] Governance page (final review, merging on Friday, April 3rd)
* \[garbas\] Landing page,
* \[davidak\] Maintain a list of project presentations that we like (and might fit our project) and explain why you like it. Then we can discuss how to copy it. We are no marketing experts, so we don’t have to be innovative here\!
* \[garbas\] [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/) “it still feels a community projects, while showing that is production ready”
* \[garbas\] [https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/tumbleweed](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/tumbleweed) nice download  page
* \[garbas\] landing page content [https://chocolatey.org/](https://chocolatey.org/)
* \[Gchristensen\] [https://www.packet.com/](https://www.packet.com/) has a nicely structured footer
* \[davidak\] [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/) commands on landing page show how intuitive and easy it is. the user knows how to use it even before installing it\!
* \[davidak\] [https://guix.gnu.org/](https://guix.gnu.org/) is a nice example how a landingpage would look like if desktop users are the audience to focus on. They present it with 3 strong words and some further description, show some screenshots under “Discover Guix”, link to “Instructional videos”, and links to some user stories under “GNU Guix in your field”. The package manager is only one section.
* \[davidak\] [https://guix.gnu.org/videos/](https://guix.gnu.org/videos/) has professional video tutorials for basic tasks, like installation, so everyone should be able to achieve this by following it closely… it is documented that people fail to install NixOS. [https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/88z7mp/first\_impression\_of\_the\_nixos\_installation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/88z7mp/first_impression_of_the_nixos_installation/) (i would like to create more NixOS videos for my personal youtube channel, like this where i run NixOS on a notebook with 256MB RAM and no ethernet [https://youtu.be/ctG0DsmcAtU](https://youtu.be/ctG0DsmcAtU) )
A cool project would be to generate videos from a script, that starts a NixOS VM and captures video output of a task, like install and text that is spoken by some deep learning network TTS. This way, the text and tasks can easily get updated and the video is always up to date. Like we generate our manual for every release.
* \[davidak\] [https://palletsprojects.com/](https://palletsprojects.com/) minimalistic design, professional icons, precise and short texts
* \[garbas\] Action item: check if donations are coming in from [https://www.redbubble.com/people/mogorman/shop](https://www.redbubble.com/people/mogorman/shop)
* Nix for reproducible science (that seems to be needed and Nix could help)
* NixOS for Gamers (how to setup Steam, which games are packaged, how to \[samueldr\] Can we still do a URL inventory of the old website? (and other post-mortem talk about the migration.) [https://logs.nix.samueldr.com/nixos-chat/2020-03-20\#1584744875-1584744837](https://logs.nix.samueldr.com/nixos-chat/2020-03-20#1584744875-1584744837);
* \[davidak\] To get closer to a point where we know how to present Nix/NixOS (e.g. on a Landingpage), we should define on which audience we want to focus. I suggest
* Developers (Nix can solve hard problems, devs might contribute back)
* Advanced/enthusiast linux users (currently using Arch/Gentoo/...)
* Server administrators using impure config. Management like Ansible, Salt, ...
* \[davidak\] I would like to have specific tutorials for different audiences, like
* NixOS as desktop operating system (what can it do for desktop users)
* NixOS for reliable server configuration and deployment
* setup VR)
* Nix for Python development (Python backend \+ JavaScript frontend)
* Nix for embedded development / cross-compilation
* NixOS on your mobile phone
* Nix for HPC
* \[davidak\] Website monitoring options
* Cookies are not an option since we don’t want the consent banner. “Cookie banners are regulated under the ePrivacy directive. In order for a company to legally set a cookie or another tracking technology on a user’s device, it first needs to obtain valid consent.” \- [https://noyb.eu/en/project/cookie-banners](https://noyb.eu/en/project/cookie-banners)
* But webserver access logs seem fine. [https://www.optimizesmart.com/ask-these-eight-questions-to-make-your-server-logs-gdpr-compliant/](https://www.optimizesmart.com/ask-these-eight-questions-to-make-your-server-logs-gdpr-compliant/) (does not look very serious, validate)
* Access logs can easily be analysed with [https://goaccess.io/](https://goaccess.io/)
* \[garbas\] This is not an option since we are hosting this on netlify. But we could use netlify analytics, if we upgrade our account (with their free community plan)
* What questions do the analytics answer? Would this solution cover that?
* …
* Instead of passively analysing logs, we could also ask directly for feedback like “was this page helpful? Did you find what you searched? Has any problems?”
