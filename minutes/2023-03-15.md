* tomberek and djacu pair on the announcement role
* Tom: no updates yet, probably more time for it over the weekend
* Delay in video may be prudent due to concerns about existing releases.
* Valentin: not excited about exciting people about things that are broken
* Please instead market things that produce great experiences, doesn’t have to limit itself to Nix specifically
* Bryan: getting more eyeballs will provide more feedback
* Valentin: disagree, the process is too broken and this is making false promises
* Patrick: is it possible to address the two different audiences of conservative and risk-inclined users clearly?
* Rok: This is for existing users to follow new features
* Still developing the process for even deciding what should go in and out
* Whoever will contribute will drive the direction
* Patrick: small suggestion which may help: include some playful language characterizing the intended audience as ‘brave’, or trying the exciting new features as part of an ‘adventure’
* something that conveys that trying out the latest version of Nix right away is both exciting and a little risky. or even including an explicit call for testing and feedback in the announcement, which will send the same signals
* John: hope as we work through the backlog of untested functionality, Nix releases will become more stable, even with no changes to the release process
* Rok: will also cut the videos in chunks and post them separately to Twitter
* Valentin:
* How can the Nix team help the marketing team? (ideally at zero cost, e.g. by shifting focus slightly)
*
* How can the documentation team help?
* Tom: produce static artifacts that we can use, such as release notes, use case examples
* Valentin: multiple months ago we discussed with Bryan about simply reading ready-made tutorials (which are known to work well) out loud; it’s a content mill which can churn out many episodes
* Rok: we need to be concise, the purpose is to create an end-to-end story; tutorials are too long
* Bryan: still think it’s a good idea, but probably youtube shorts is a better place for this
* Can you imagine a feedback loop back to the Nix maintainers and docs team?
* Tom: is there anything we can produce that would complement doc team efforts?
* Valentin: Yes, showcase major use cases that work flawlessly (stress: not oriented around novelty, but quality\!)
* Patrick: should we reach out to existing Youtubers for collaboration opportunities
* Rok: have to figure out attribution, e.g. if someone working at a company does a video
* John: supposedly youtubers will want to publish from their own channels
* Tom: "yes"
* Survey (survey.nixos.org)
* Rok: make the survey website working
* Valentin: get us more questions on the documentation topic
* [2022 usability study questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ezcl5AheVyKHLkTUX9I6sBWjYReznU_GEzKFyaegPQQ)
