## Agenda
## Please write below topics you would like to discuss and also a name who proposed the topic. Minutes can be written inline and extracted out later.
* \[graham+idlework\] Docker had a playground with user monitoring and analytics to find out usability issues in the early days. Could we do something like that?
* \[davidak\] ANN: Community page redesign
* \[davidak\] ANN: Donate page
* \[garbas\] How is Foundation standing with funds? Do we have any known budget? Is this public somewhere? Should it be public?
* \[davidak\] the foundation decided to use Open Collective in [https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-foundation/issues/1\#issuecomment-513474468](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-foundation/issues/1#issuecomment-513474468) \-\> [https://opencollective.com/nixos/expenses](https://opencollective.com/nixos/expenses) / [https://opencollective.com/nixos\#section-budget](https://opencollective.com/nixos#section-budget)
* I would consider this work as a preparation for times when our AWS is not going to be covered. We need to know how much we are spending.
* Based on how much we are spending, we (marketing team) can look for ways to engage with contributors and ask for donations.
* While most of the community will consider this boring work it is crucial for the health of the whole community. Consider this a basic hygiene.
* \[davidak\] ANN: First Guide: How to Contribute
* More can be added. What topic would we like to have? Only for users or also contributors, like “How to backport changes to stable branch”?
* \[garbas\] Landing page
* Nix or NixOS
* \[garbas\] Commercial support
* Currently there was a list of companies, but got removed with community page redesign
* We might want to make this more visible to be considered more production ready. But we need to keep still a community vibe.
* We need to make sure representation is fair (alphabetical or randomize order)
* We might consider a place where companies might want to share their success stories.
* Should this be a completely separate site (eg. nixos.com :P), maybe?
* Examples of how this is done: \<TODO\>
* \[garbas\] Process of a redesign
* Budget
* Timeline
* What do we need to prepare?
* \[ebopp\] Quickstart guide
* Quickstart has focus on web development with Python
* this was the quickest example for me to set up
* not necessarily addresses the most important target audience
* Haskell or Rust may be better? Just guessing here… SURVEY\!
* Is the focus too narrow? Should we present something more generic? What?
* Should we have multiple versions for different application domains?
* Draft: [https://gist.github.com/aepsil0n/47fa7db73689f2362300e61e35a95e6b](https://gist.github.com/aepsil0n/47fa7db73689f2362300e61e35a95e6b)
