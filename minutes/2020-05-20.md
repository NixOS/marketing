## Agenda
## Please write below topics you would like to discuss and also a name who proposed the topic. Minutes can be written inline and extracted out later.
* \[garbas\] ANN: Landing page
* Simplified. More info in the PR itself: [https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pull/425](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pull/425)
* \[garbas\] ANN: search.nixos.org, currently at [https://nixos-search.netlify.com](https://nixos-search.netlify.com)
* Explain the goals (short/middle/long)
* Show current status and discuss
* (from last time) \[garbas\] Community survey
* \[davidak\] I had that idea before: [https://discourse.nixos.org/t/idea-yearly-nixos-community-survey/2814](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/idea-yearly-nixos-community-survey/2814)
I have planned to create a concept and a technical prototype. I would like to have a team that execute it once a year (marketing is a perfect fit)

* (from last time) \[davidak\] History page
* The project exists for some time now. Do we want to have a History page with all the details how we got to the current state?
* \[garbas\] Should link to Armijn’s NixCon 2019 talk.
* (from last time) \[davidak\] Do we want to have a Mastodon account as decentralised and free software alternative to Twitter? It can be synced with Twitter, so no extra work. I already met many Nix and NixOS users there and it would be great to be able to mention @nixos@someinstance.tld instead of \#nixos which is also good. That way people can click the profile, click the website link and find out about our project and also subscribe for announcements. [https://discourse.nixos.org/t/whos-using-the-fediverse-mastodon/1370](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/whos-using-the-fediverse-mastodon/1370)
[https://fosstodon.org/about](https://fosstodon.org/about) looks like a good instance for us
* (from last time) \[davidak\] Could it be part of our story that “NixOS is constantly improving. It get’s better with every release.”? [https://discourse.nixos.org/t/marketing-team-can-we-present-nix-nixos-better/6249/61?u=davidak](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/marketing-team-can-we-present-nix-nixos-better/6249/61?u=davidak)
* TODO: explain release process
* \[ebopp\] Usability testing (→ [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability\_testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing))
* I did a tiny usability test with one person (Ubuntu user, data scientist, heard of Nix, but never used it) to get a first feeling for how nice the on-boarding experience for new users is right now
* Orthogonal to surveys & playground data analytics:
* Helps empathize with user by seeing them interact with software
* Comparatively cheap to carry out, no development necessary
* Quickly check assumptions and find most obvious issues
* Cannot be done with representative sample of users easily
* Need to find people to test with, here are further ideas
* [https://docs.google.com/document/d/14i6ND7gD9gPnDd60huL8reX3kEtovUSyUtBoKSOozEs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14i6ND7gD9gPnDd60huL8reX3kEtovUSyUtBoKSOozEs/edit?usp=sharing)
* Maybe record session to show people what it is like
* \[ebopp\] Guides & RFC-64
* Bit of a controversial discussion here: [https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pull/418](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pull/418)
* How to proceed?
* \[domenkozar\] Started writing tutorials at https://nix.dev/
