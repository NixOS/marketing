Dear Nix Foundation Board,

I am writing to formally request funding for the Nix Marketing team, which plays a critical role in the growth, accessibility, and overall sustainability of the Nix community. As we continue to evolve, it has become evident that our outreach and community engagement efforts require structured financial support to ensure we operate as a serious, mature organization.

### Challenges We Face

Currently, we observe several key challenges within the Nix ecosystem:

- Lack of clear newcomer guidance: Many users struggle to find structured pathways to productivity in Nix/NixOS, making it difficult for them to succeed and fully integrate into the community.
- Non-linear open-source growth: While interest in Nix is growing, our expansion lacks consistency, leaving new contributors with an often confusing UX experience.
- Limited diversity & inclusion efforts: Existing community members have expressed concerns over the lack of representation among non-he/him contributors, highlighting the need for a more inclusive outreach approach.

To address these issues effectively, the Nix Marketing team requires financial support for both operational stability and strategic outreach.

### Proposed Budget Allocation

We request funding to support the following efforts:

- Marketing Team Lead (20-30 hours/month) – To oversee communication, branding, and outreach efforts, ensuring consistency in how we present Nix to newcomers and the broader open-source world.
- Webmaster (20-30 hours/month) – To maintain and improve our web presence, making information more accessible and structured for both new and existing users.
- Community Representation at Key Events – A budget for physical assets (banners, stickers, printed materials) and a well-prepared visibility plan to ensure Nix is effectively represented at:
  - NixCon (nixcon.org)
  - SCALE (SoCal Linux Expo)
  - FOSDEM

**Why This Matters**
Without structured marketing efforts, Nix risks stagnating in growth, both in adoption and contributor diversity. The requested budget will ensure that we can attract, guide, and retain new users while reinforcing our presence in the broader open-source landscape. Most importantly, it will help establish Nix as a well-maintained and mature project with a clear onboarding experience and a welcoming community for all.

I appreciate your time and consideration and look forward to discussing how we can move forward with this initiative.

Best regards,
Ida Bzowska
The Nix Marketing Team
